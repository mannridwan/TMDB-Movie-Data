# TMDB-Movie-Data
## Investigating the TMDB Movie Datasets - An elementary insight into understanding data analysis using Python
## Introduction
For this project, I will conduct a data analysis on a chosen dataset and create a file to share that documents my findings. I will start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions I can answer using it. Using pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, I will create a report to commuicate my findngs. I will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project

The chosen dataset is the TMDB Movie DataSets which contains about 10,000 movies including features like user ratings and revenue.
### Summary of Findings
In the analysis, questions answered were focused on popularity, profitability and revenue of the movies. For the profitablity and revenue, special conisderation was given to show the effect of inflation the figures since the movies were not released in the same year.
